# Getting started
The first thing we need is some MeshyDB credentials. If you have not you can get started with a free account at [MeshyDB.com](https://meshydb.com).

Once we have done that we can go to Account and get our Client Key and Public Key.

Now that we have the required information let's jump in and see how easy it is to start with MeshyDB.

## Login
Let's log in using our MeshyDB credentials.

``` rest
POST https://api.meshydb.com/{clientKey}/connect/token
Body(x-www-form-urlencoded):  
  client_id={publicKey}&grant_type=password&username={username}&password={password}&scope=meshy.api%20offline_access

Example Response:
  {
    "access_token": "ey...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "refresh_token": "ab23cd3343e9328g"
  }
```

```c#
  var database = new MeshyDB({clientKey}, {publicKey});
  var client = database.LoginWithPassword({username}, {password});
```

_clientKey_: 
  Indicates which tenant you are connecting for authentication.
  
_publicKey_: 
  Public accessor for application.
  
_username_:
  User name.

_password_:
  User password.
 
## Create data
Now that we are logged in we can use our Bearer token to authenticate requests with MeshyDB and create some data.

``` rest
POST https://api.meshydb.com/{clientKey}/meshes/{mesh}
Headers:
  Authentication: Bearer {access_token}
Body(json):
  {
    "firstName": "Bob",
    "lastName": "Bobberson"
  }
  
Example Response:
  {
    "_id":"5c78cc81dd870827a8e7b6c4",
    "firstName": "Bob",
    "lastName": "Bobberson"
    "_rid":"https://api.meshydb.com/{clientKey}/meshes/{mesh}/5c78cc81dd870827a8e7b6c4"
  }
```

```c#
// Mesh is derived from class name
public class Person: MeshData
{
  public string FirstName { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }
}

var person = await client.Meshes.CreateAsync(new Person(){
  FirstName="Bob",
  LastName="Bobberson"
});
```

_clientKey_: 
  Indicates which tenant you are connecting for authentication.
 
 _access_token_:
  Token identifying authorization with MeshyDB requested during [Login](#login)
_mesh_:
  Identifies name of mesh collection. e.g. person.
