Meshy DB is a relational json solution as a backend for rapid and flexible implementation.

What is a Mesh?
===============
A Mesh is a container that we use to store your data dynamically.

It can represent any number of things to let you better focus on your front-end while we take care of the back-end.

We can use a mesh to represent a store, person, football or anything else we may want to persist long term.

One of the benifits of using a Mesh is you can dynamically change its definition as needed without worrying about previous data loss and migration concerns. If you are no longer collecting a piece of data and want to restore it later just reinclude it as part of your definition.

Data Storage
============
Because a Mesh defines your data it is isolated from all other data. You can manipulate your definition to your hearts content without concern of interacting without worry.
